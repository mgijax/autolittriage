These are the error log files from the production littriage loads of the
backpopulation batches. There are 10 batches.

I'm keeping these just in case we want to go back and study or resolve any of
the errors.
Probably won't want to do this since the vast majority of backpopulating
PDFs are loaded with no problem, and all we really care about is getting a
reasonable size corpus of backpopulated examples.

But just in case.
