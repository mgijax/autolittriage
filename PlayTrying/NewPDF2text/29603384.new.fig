At E11.5, we did not observe any NG2 immunoreactivity in the olig21 pMN domain, although pericytes lining capillaries were already intensely labelled for NG2 (data not shown). At E12.5, NG2 started labeling a subpopulation of cells in the olig2-expressing VZ domain ( Figure 1a1,a2). At this stage, only few NG21/Olig21 somas could be found outside the pMN domain in the ventral parenchyma and none in the MZ. However, we observed numerous NG2-positive glial processes running through the parenchyma and into the MZ to contact the basal lamina ( Figures 1a3 and 2). These NG2-positive glial processes were more abundant around the motor exit point (MEP), where cholinergic MN axons exit the spinal cord ( Figures 1a3 and 2). Discrete spots of NG2 immunoreactivity could also be observed lining the central canal, suggesting that the first OPCs generated by the pMN domain exhibit a radial morphology—that is with radial processes contacting the basal lamina as well as the central canal. Because these morphological features were reminiscent of neuroepithelial precursors, also known as radial glial cells at this developmental stage, we performed coimmunostaining for NG2 and Nestin, a marker of neuroepithelial precursors ( Figure 2). We found a high degree of co-localization between NG2 and Nestin in glial processes located in the MZ around the MEP, suggesting a subset of neuroepithelial precursors transiently co-express Nestin and NG2 as they start differentiating into OPCs at E12.5.

Accordingly, we also observed a high degree of co-localization between NG2 and GLAST, a transmembrane glutamate astrocyte transporter known to be expressed in the membrane of neuroepithelial precursors at this developmental stage ( Figure 2c; Barry, Pakan, O’Keeffe, & McDermott, 2013; Shibata et al., 1997).
---------------
At E13.5, numerous NG21/Olig21 cells were observed in the pMN domain ( Figure 1b1,b2,e3) but very few at E14.5 ( Figure 1c1,c2, e3). These results confirmed that the emergence of pioneer OPCs from their neuro-epithelial precursors in the pMN domain is restricted to a short time window starting at E12.5 and tapering at E14.5.

the MEP where the highest density of NG2-positive glial endfeet was previously observed at E12.5 ( Figures 1a3 and 2). Indeed, the density of NG21/Olig21 cells was significantly higher in the part of the MZ surrounding the MEP compared with any other areas of the embryonic spinal cord ( Figure 1e2). Taken together, these observations suggest a particular affinity of pioneer OPCs for the MZ surrounding the MEP. This area is known to contain cholinergic MN axons and dendrites as well as longitudinal axons from GABAergic and glutamatergic premotor INs (Czarnecki et al., 2014; Vaughn et al., 1974). We previously

To determine whether axoglial synapses could also be formed onto pioneer OPCs in the MZ, we first performed co-immunostainings for NG2 with either VGluT2 or VIAAT, which stain putative vesicular release sites for glutamate and GABA/Glycine vesicular transporters, respectively ( Figure 3). Immunostainings were performed using CNP-EGFP mouse embryos to easily discriminate NG21/CNP-EGFP1 OPCs from NG21/ CNP-EGFP- pericytes. In these mice, MNs exhibited a low level of EGFP expression, a likely consequence of the expression of EGFP in the pMN domain at earlier developmental stages. As previously described (Czarnecki et al., 2014), we first confirmed that VGluT2 and VIAATimmunoreactive aggregates were mostly restricted to the MZ. Both VIAAT and VGLUT2 aggregates could be found apposing to NG21/ CNP-EGFP1 processes and cell bodies ( Figure 3), suggesting that vesicular synaptic release of GABA and glutamate may indeed occur from longitudinal axons to OPC processes and cell bodies located in the MZ.

determine whether these putative synaptic contacts were functional, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of EGFP1 cells located in the MZ using whole spinal cord preparations obtained from E13.5 and E14.5 CNP-EGFP mouse embryos. Virtually all EGFP1 cells located in the MZ were found positive for NG2 and Olig2 immunolabeling ( Figure 4C). To further confirm that CNP-EGFP1 cells recorded in the MZ were OPCs, we filled some of them with biocytin through the patch pipette and performed post-hoc staining for NG2. All biocytin-filled CNPEGFP1 cells were found positive for NG2 immunolabeling (6/6 cells). They exhibited an elongated morphology along the longitudinal axis with their processes aligned to funicular axons, a morphological feature typical of OPCs found in axon tracts ( Figure 4). Recorded EGFP1 cells had an average capacitance of 10.2 6 2.6 pF (N 5 40) and an average input resistance of 1.81 6 0.44 GX (N 5 40). Recorded cells displayed significant voltagegated outward K1 currents but little or no voltage-gated inward Na1 currents, as expected for OPCs ( Figure 4). Recorded cells were unable to fire action potentials when recorded in current-clamp mode (data not shown).

Fast-rising inward currents were fully blocked by superfusion of DL-APV and CNQX (N 5 8) as well as by CNQX alone (N 5 9). Taken together, our results demonstrate the existence of functional synapses between longitudinal glutamatergic axons located in the MZ and OPCs, at least as early as

To assess the presence of GABA/glycine postsynaptic currents, we recorded OPC at a holding potential of 0 mV, the cationic equilibrium potential in our experimental conditions ( Figure 5b). In this configuration, OPCs displayed spontaneous outward currents with an average amplitude of 4.4 6 0.7 pA, a rise time (20%–80%) of 1.81 6 0.15 ms and a decay time constant of 86.75 6 10.21 ms (N 5 10; Figure 5b). Superfusion of the GABAAR selective antagonist Gabazine (10 lM) fully blocked these outward sPSC (N 5 6; Figure 5b1,b2) confirming that they were GABAergic events. Outward sPSCs had an average frequency of 0.017 6 0.003 Hz and were almost completely blocked by TTX superfusion (1 lM; 298.27% 6 5.19%, p < .01; N 5 9; Figure 9b5). Finally, direct electrical stimulation of funicular axons was found to elicit slow rising outward currents with an average amplitude of 10.1 6 2.8 pA (N 5 9) that were also blocked by superfusion of

gabazine (N 5 6; Figure 6d,e). These results indicate that, in addition to glutamatergic synapses, functional GABAergic axoglial synapses are also formed between GABAergic axons located in the MZ and pioneer OPCs as soon as E13.5.

onto the radial processes of neuro-epithelial precursors as they start differentiating into OPCs, we investigated the presence of axoglial synapses onto nestin-positive processes located around the MEP at E12.5. Indeed, we found that most nestin-positive processes located in the MEP appear to co-express the proteoglycan NG2 at this stage ( Figure 2). Strikingly, electron microscopy revealed the presence of synaptic-like axoglial contacts onto nestin-positive endfeet located in the MEP ( Figure 7). These observations indicate that axoglial synapses could already be forming onto the endfeet of neuro-epithelial precursors as they commit to an OPC fate.

onto OPCs. Immunostainings for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter vAChT labeled numerous putative release sites around MN soma and inside the MZ, localized specifically around the MEP ( Figure 8). Strikingly, many of these vAChT-positive puncta in the MEP were found in the direct vicinity of NG21/CNP-EGFP1 soma and processes, supporting the hypothesis that pioneer OPCs around the MEP could be influenced by acetylcholine released from MNs.

current in any of the recorded OPCs (N 5 10), suggesting that AchR are not functional or are not expressed by pioneer OPCs in the embryonic spinal cord. In contrast, we observed that the same application of acetylcholine significantly increased the frequency of both glutamatergic and GABAergic spontaneous PSCs ( Figure 9a2,b2). Acetylcholine had no significant effect on the average amplitude of glutamatergic (control:

6 1.9 pA, N 5 10) and GABAergic (control: 5.35 6 1.6 pA vs. Ach: 4.9 6 1.5 pA, N 5 7) spontaneous PSCs. The action of acetylcholine on the frequency of glutamatergic and GABAergic spontaneous PSC was blocked by the co-superfusion of mecamylamine (50 mM) and d-tubocurarine (5 mM; Figure 9a3,b3). Mecamylamine is a non-competitive nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist (Arias et al., 2010) and D-Tubocurarine is a classical non-selective nAChR antagonist (Jonsson et al., 2006). It has been previously shown that the combination of these two antagonists is necessary and sufficient in order to suppress cholinergic transmission in the embryonic mouse spinal cord (Hanson & Landmesser, 2003). The effect of acetylcholine application on the frequency of glutamatergic and GABAergic PSCs could be mimicked by the application of nicotine (10 mM; Figures 9a4, b4). Nicotine had no effect on the average amplitude of glutamatergic (control: 27.9 6 1.4 pA vs. nicotine: 28.1 6 1.6 pA, N 5 8) and GABAergic (control: 4.2 6 1.4 pA vs. nicotine: 4.4 6 1.4 pA, N 5 10) spontaneous

We found that the ability of nicotine to potentiate the frequency of both GABAergic and glutamatergic PSC was preserved in the presence of TTX (1 mM; Figure 9a5,b5), showing that nicotine and acetylcholine can promote PSC frequency by acting onto nAChR expressed by the presynaptic terminals of axoglial synapses.

of spontaneous glutamatergic PSCs (27.8 6 1.3 pA) and spontaneous GABAergic PSCs (6.0 6 0.5 pA) recorded in control conditions in the same cells. To test whether endogenous source of acetylcholine could therefore participate to potentiate axoglial transmission onto OPC, we investigated the influence of nAChR antagonists onto sPSCs ( Figures 9a3,a7,b3,b7) and onto PSCs evoked by direct electrical stimulation of funicular axons ( Figure 6c,f). We found that the cosuperfusion of mecamylamine (50 mM) and d-tubocurarine (5 mM) had little influence on glutamatergic sPSC frequency ( Figure 9a3,a7) and on the amplitude of evoked glutamatergic PSCs ( Figure 6c). By contrast, cosuperfusion of mecamylamine (50 mM) and d-tubocurarine (5 mM) significantly decreased GABAergic sPSC frequency ( Figure 9b3,b7) as well as the amplitude of evoked GABAergic PSCs ( Figure 6f), thus indicating that endogenous cholinergic signaling act preferentially onto GABAergic axoglial synapses.

(Matta et al., 2007). To assess the distribution and proliferation rate of pioneer OPCs, we quantified the number of cells expressing Olig21 cells and Olig21/Ki671 in different parts of the MZ, in the ventral parenchyma, and in the dorsal parenchyma of E14.5 embryos treated with either saline or nicotine ( Figure 10a). We found that nicotine increased the density of Olig21 cells in the MZ surrounding the MEP and in the ventral parenchyma by twofold compared with saline-treated embryos ( Figure 10b). By contrast, density of Olig21 cells did not appear to be affected in the lateral and ventral part of the marginal zone, nor in the dorsal parenchyma. Moreover, we found that chronic nicotine treatment significantly increased the percentage of Olig21 cells co-expressing Ki67 around the MEP by twofold compared with saline-treated embryos ( Figure 10c). Taken together, our results show that chronic nicotine treatment during gliogenesis preferentially increases the density and proliferation of OPC located in the MZ surrounding the MEP.

associated with the appearance of a transient population of radial glial cells co-expressing both OPC and neuro-epithelial precursor markers. Second, we observed that the pool of olig2-expressing neuro-epithelial precursor in the pMN domain is drastically depleted at E14.5 (see Figure 1e3) right after the first wave of OPC has been generated. Taken together, these observations support the hypothesis that pMN precursors directly transform into OPCs by detaching from the ventricular zone to follow their radial process into the marginal zone. This would also explain why the soma of pioneer OPCs

suggests that axoglial synapses may even participate to trigger, or at least regulate, OPC genesis from neuroepithelial precursors. Indeed, electron microscopy show that the emergence of OPCs from neuro-epithelial precursors is concomitant with the formation of synaptic-like axoglial contacts onto neuro-epithelial precursors glial processes located in the marginal zone (see Figure 7; Henrikson & Vaughn, 1974). Moreover, our results suggest that the potentiation of glutamatergic and/or GABAergic axoglial transmission by nicotine could not only favor the secondary proliferation of pioneer OPCs in the marginal zone surrounding the MEP, but also facilitate the recruitment of neuro-epithelial precursors into OPC. Indeed, we observed that fetal nicotine exposure could increase OPC density in the ventral parenchyma without any increase in their local proliferation rate (see Figure 10). Therefore, these supernumerary parenchymal OPCs must have been generated elsewhere. Because they are located along the path likely to be taken by most pioneer OPCs right after they leave the pMN domain, their most likely origin would therefore be the pMN domain itself. Indeed, they are located along the path traced by NG2/nestin radial glial endfeets at E12.5 (see Figures 1a and 2) and we showed that pioneer OPCs transiently accumulate in the ventral parenchyma at E13.5 before colonizing the marginal zone at E14.5 (see Figure 1e2).
