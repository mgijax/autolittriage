onto sPSCs ( Figures 9a3,a7,b3,b7) and onto PSCs evoked by direct electrical stimulation of funicular axons ( Figure 6c,f). We found that the cosuperfusion of mecamylamine (50 mM) and d-tubocurarine (5 mM) had little influence on glutamatergic sPSC frequency ( Figure 9a3,a7) and on the amplitude of evoked glutamatergic PSCs ( Figure 6c). By contrast, cosuperfusion of mecamylamine (50 mM) and d-tubocurarine (5 mM) significantly decreased GABAergic sPSC frequency ( Figure 9b3,b7) as well as the amplitude of evoked GABAergic PSCs ( Figure 6f), thus indicating that endogenous cholinergic signaling act preferentially onto GABAergic axoglial synapses.

twofold compared with saline-treated embryos ( Figure 10b). By contrast, density of Olig21 cells did not appear to be affected in the lateral and ventral part of the marginal zone, nor in the dorsal parenchyma. Moreover, we found that chronic nicotine treatment significantly increased the percentage of Olig21 cells co-expressing Ki67 around the MEP by twofold compared with saline-treated embryos ( Figure 10c). Taken together, our results show that chronic nicotine treatment during gliogenesis preferentially increases the density and proliferation of OPC located in the MZ surrounding the MEP.

Because they are located along the path likely to be taken by most pioneer OPCs right after they leave the pMN domain, their most likely origin would therefore be the pMN domain itself. Indeed, they are located along the path traced by NG2/nestin radial glial endfeets at E12.5 (see Figures 1a and 2) and we showed that pioneer OPCs transiently accumulate in the ventral parenchyma at E13.5 before colonizing the marginal zone at E14.5 (see Figure 1e2). We hypothesize that the formation of axoglial synapses allow glial precursors to insure that the neuronal components of the ventral spinal
